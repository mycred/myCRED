An adaptive and powerful points management system for WordPress powered websites.

== Description ==

myCred is an intelligent and adaptive **points management system** that allows you to build and manage a broad range of digital rewards including points, ranks and, badges on your WordPress/WooCommerce powered website. 

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M19tzYo1jo]

Build **brand loyalty** by rewarding your customers through store reward systems, community leaderboards, monetizing your website content, etc. - The possibilities are endless. 

**Increase customer engagement tenfold - Rewarding your users for community engagement will help your business grow.**

= AMAZING AWARD SYSTEMS TO ENGAGE AND REWARD LOYAL CUSTOMERS =

myCred allows **THREE different ways** through which you can award your users:

* **Points -** Set events and triggers to allow real-time tracking and automatically award your users with points. 

* **Ranks -** Set ranks within your leaderboards and reward your users with significant perks after they reach a certain milestone.

* **Badges -** Boost your users' participation by rewarding them for their exceptional performance.

**Latest update - myCred v2.3**

**myCred v2.3** is a core update that helps the admin award points, badges and ranks to users in bulk. Similarly, the admin can also choose to revoke these award types from multiple users simultaneously.

Here are some of the most prominent features of the latest update:

* A “Bulk Assign” tool for awarding/revoking points, badges, and ranks in bulk.
* The admin can exclude any user role from receiving points. Previously, the admin could only exclude users using user ID only.
* A timeframe attribute in [mycred_my_balance_converted] shortcode - users can see their converted point balance in a given timeframe using predefined filters (Yesterday, Today, this week, this month, last month).

**Last update - myCred v2.2**

**myCred v2.2** focuses on improving the overall user interface, single badge page layout, point-type image, and social media sharing for a better user experience and operational efficiency.

* **New UI design of the main menu** - A fresh new look of our main menu allows users to easily navigate between logs, hooks, and general settings.
* **Upload Point-type image** - Give your point type a unique identity by assigning them an image.
* **Enable/Disable add-ons** - Save time and use toggle buttons for enabling or disabling add-ons. 
* **Social share setting** - Allow users to share their achieved badges on their social profiles.
* **Treasures** - A brand new collection of attractive graphical images that can be used for ranks and badges.
* **Suggestions** - Submit your ideas and suggestions on the new suggestion page.

= Features =
= Point Management =
Empower your WordPress website users by rewarding them points - each user has their own POINT BALANCE that can be used in purchasing online products or online activities.

**- Point Balances**: Each user on your website will have their own point balance, where they'll be able to gain/lose viewpoints.
**- Account History**: Each time a user gains or loses points on your website, the transaction is logged into a central log for accountability.
**- Points Management**: You have full control over your users' point balances; You can adjust your user/s balance by adding or removing points with or without a log entry.
**- Automatic Points**: Automatically award or deduct points from your user's balance for their interaction on your WordPress/WooCommerce website.
**- Multiple Point Types**: Create multiple point types through the admin area to manage things easily. There is no limit to the number of point types you can have at your disposal.
**- Buy Points**: The buyCred add-on allows your users to purchase points using real money using some of the most popular payment gateways available in the market today.
**- Store Payments**: myCred supports some of the most popular store plugins for WordPress, allowing your users to pay for orders/tickets using their point balance instead of real money.

= Badges =

**-  Open Badge Functionality** - new opportunities to recognize and validate achievements digitally.
**-  Add badge details** (name, achievement, website details, etc.).

= cashCred =
**GIVE USERS THE POWER TO CONVERT THEIR MYCRED POINTS INTO REAL MONEY.**

cashCred is a built-in myCred add-on that allows users to redeem myCred points for real money anytime, anywhere. Give users the power to earn points through myCred's intelligent rewards system. Instead of giving them cash, you reward them with points that can be encashed at any time.

cashCred works perfectly with a reward system that engages users to perform activities that require user interaction (watching a video, filling out a survey, and more).

**-  Convert Points to Cash** - Users can redeem myCred points for money.
**-  Multiple Point Types** - Allow multiple custom point types.
**-  Exchange Rates** - Define exchange rates for each point type.

**-  Ranks (%rank_title% and %rank_image%)** - Display users' new rank title and image in the outgoing email.

= Dedicated Log =
Each time myCred adds or deducts points from a user, the adjustment is logged in a dedicated log, allowing your users to browse their history. This log keeps a record of your user's accountability, badges, and ranks, among other useful statistics.

This log data can be converted into charts to help you visualize the usage and circulation of points on your website.

You can achieve the following features by using a dedicated log for your points system:

- Set a limit to the maximum number of times each hook can give out points to your user.
- Badges will use the log's data to determine which user has earned a badge.
- Add-ons such as Sell Content use the log to track users who have purchased posts from your website.
- Add-ons use the log to ensure that a user does not gain repetitive points for the same interaction within a given time frame.

-  Detailed badge categorization.
