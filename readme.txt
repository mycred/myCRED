**- Point Balances**: Each user on your website will have their own point balance, where they'll be able to gain/lose viewpoints.
**- Account History**: Each time a user gains or loses points on your website, the transaction is logged into a central log for accountability.

**- Automatic Points**: Automatically award or deduct points from your user's balance for their interaction on your WordPress/WooCommerce website.

**- Store Payments**: myCred supports some of the most popular store plugins for WordPress, allowing your users to pay for orders/tickets using their point balance instead of real money.
**- Upload Point-type image**: Give your point type a unique identity by assigning them an image.

cashCred is a built-in myCred add-on that allows users to redeem myCred points for real money anytime, anywhere. Give users the power to earn points through myCred's intelligent rewards system. Instead of giving them cash, you reward them with points that can be encashed at any time.

= Dedicated Log =
Each time myCred adds or deducts points from a user, the adjustment is logged in a dedicated log, allowing your users to browse their history. This log keeps a record of your user's accountability, badges, and ranks, among other useful statistics.

This log data can be converted into charts to help you visualize the usage and circulation of points on your website.

You can achieve the following features by using a dedicated log for your points system:

- Set a limit to the maximum number of times each hook can give out points to your user.
- Badges will use the log's data to determine which user has earned a badge.
- Add-ons such as Sell Content use the log to track users who have purchased posts from your website.
- Add-ons use the log to ensure that a user does not gain repetitive points for the same interaction within a given time frame.
