= Features =

**- Point Balances:** Each user on your website will have their own point balance, where they'll be able to view points that were gained/lost.
**- Account History:** Each time a user gains or loses points on your website, the transaction is logged into a central log for accountability.
**- Points Management:** You have full control over your users' point balances; You can adjust your user/s balance by adding or removing points with or without a log entry.
**- White-Labeling:** myCred has built-in support for white-labeling - This allows you to rename the plugin in your admin area to anything you like.
**- Import & Export:** myCred comes with three built-in import tools allowing you to import points, log entries, or migrate your CubePoints installation.
**- Automatic Points:** Automatically award or deduct points from your user's balance for their interaction on your Wordpress/WooCommerce website.
**- Multiple Point Types:** Create multiple point types through the admin area to manage things easily. There is no limit to the number of point types you can have at your disposal. 
**- Multi-Site Support:** myCred has built-in support for multi-sites, allowing you to choose between using a unique myCred installation or centralize balances across your network.
**- Leaderboards:** Generate leaderboards based on your user's balance or points history - display users with the most points for a particular instance. 
**- Badges:** Award badges to your users based on their points history. You can set certain requirements for this feature so that myCred automatically awards them to the deserving users.

= AN ATTRACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE POINTS AND REWARDS SYSTEM =

Empower your WordPress website users by rewarding them points - each user has their own **POINT BALANCE** that can be used in purchasing online products or online activities.

Not only will you be able to manually adjust the point balance system at any time, but you can also set up multiple point types and use them for different kinds of activities. How these point balances are accessed, used, or displayed are entirely up to you.

= AWARD OR DEDUCT POINTS AUTOMATICALLY =

**myCred** supports an extensive set of WordPress interactions through which you can automatically give/take points from a user. These actions can be as simple as logging in, publishing content, or leaving a comment. These automatic adjustments are managed by a feature called “[Hooks](https://mycred.me/about/features/#automatic-points)” that can be set up in your admin area.


= DEDICATED LOG =

Each time **myCred** adds or deducts points from a user, the adjustment is [logged](https://mycred.me/about/features/#account-history) in a dedicated log, allowing your users to browse their history. This log keeps a record of your user’s accountability, badges, and ranks, among other useful statistics.

This log data can be converted into charts to help you visualize the usage and circulation of points on your website.

You can achieve the following features by using a dedicated log for your points system:

* Set a limit to the maximum number of times each hook can give out points to your user.
* Badges will use the log’s data to determine which user has earned a badge.
* Add-ons such as â€œSell Contentâ€ use the log to keep track of users who have purchased posts from your website.
* Add-ons use the log to make sure that a user does not gain repetitive points for the same interaction within a given time frame.

= BUILT-IN ADD-ONS =

myCred is much more than just a point management system - The plugin comes with several [built-in add-ons](https://www.mycred.me/add-ons/) that enable you to perform complex tasks such as transfer or buy points for real money, allow payments in stores, etc. 

**- Badges:** Award your users badges based on their points history.
**- buyCred:** Let your users buy points in exchange for real money.
